he invited m^ to call, and named the day and hour. I had an hour

He said he had no objection to inform me privately, and tndz" 
vidually [of] any thing and every thing I might wish to Imow, in rela- 
tion to the object of my mission, satisfied that I was fully entitled to 
make to me with the Executive of Texas, in my communicaticms, and 
should be given to any opinions he might utter, or information he 
might Communicate to m^ as above. 
He then proceeded to State his own individual opinion (favourable 
to an amicable and prompt arrangement.) 
The opinion of the President is wholly opposed to recognition, but 
would perhaps assent to an Armistice; and in like manner, the 
balance of the Cabinet — ^vrz: Almonte, opposed to any inmiediate 
action, and probably wishes to negotiate at the Head of an Army. 
The Secretary then informed me what he had done to Secure for 
the Councils of Govmt. and others out, of oftice, and written to some 
out of the city. That he had found some to concur with himself, 
others willing to do something, less than recognition; and others 
who were opposed to any arrangement. He hxid become convinced

much to keep the subject open, and give it all the impulse he could, 
personal and official influence endeavour to gain, in favour of the 
general question, sufficient supporters to justify the Govemmt, in
