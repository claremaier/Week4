#Finally!
I'm finally getting to understand this!
**So Cool**
*Look what I can do*


#Brief fail-log before actually creating the final one
I'm creating this markup file in nano in my terminal. This in itself is a positive step for me because it means I found it, opened it, and will be able to "add" "commit" and "push" it to a safe place (github).
I found this module easier than the previous ones, which means I am learning something finally!
Now I'm actually looking forward to mucking around with the final project.

Used built-in Terminal - can see physical files on my computer - way easier
had some trouble at the beginning understanding the task and how to get started
*note: look through command line and find other notes to consolidate into one "fail-log"*
I made much more use of the Slack channel other people posted *review and credit people* and some initial use of my brother to walk me through the regex concepts *still a bit fuzzy, but the notes and place to play around are helping*
Other than simple typing errors and not reading closely enough (yes, we were warned), things went pretty well. 
I did do down and work with the command strings at the bottom of the tutorial after thinking about it and trying to piece it together myself. **this is the next step I will have to work on** - I expect using the testing website to "play around" with regex a bit more will be useful.

On to exercise two - making sense of the csv file (I think)
